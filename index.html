        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a freshman at the University of California, Riverside, my journey has just begun. Although I have only been a student here for nearly two months now, my experiences that I have embarked on have made me the person I am today who got me to this university. During my high school years, I was a very involved student who played key officer roles in over five clubs and organizations, and also partook in an internship which gave me the opportunity and skill set to collaborate with others and create my own business plan. Over the summer of my senior year, I also used my leadership and communication skills to take a job position at Target where I worked heavily with customers and their questions or concerns.  As Iâ€™ve taken the time to reflect on how these experiences have shaped me, I can evidently see that I have brought these skills with me in the classroom and in the outside world as well. 
<br><br>

        For my high school experiences, with being in a range of different clubs and organizations that had a different goal for society and students, I was able to get a well rounded education of a wide range of different topics. Being the president of my Magnolia Agriscience Community Center (MACC) and an officer in my Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), the two clubs were extremely different yet gave me the opportunity to indulge in two different types of fields of profession. Being involved and pushing myself out of my comfort zone to interact and network with people in fields of business and environmental sciences helped me narrow down what I wanted to do as a career when Iâ€™m older, and shape the type of work I want to do in the future. Seeing different day to day lives of certain jobs gave me a better understanding of what my life could look like, and how I can navigate myself to find something Iâ€™m passionate about. Due to this realization, I found that I wanted to help others and give back to the community. At my school, I took up an internship over the summer of my junior year to grow, sell, and donate produce to families in need or who lived in food deserts to give them better nutritious food options to eat. Reflecting on this job, I can see myself continuing to do something in this direction that would help give me a sense of purpose in the real world. 
<br><br>

        With high school coming to an end, I knew I needed to continue to work and utilize the skills I discovered within myself during my previous years. With some searching, I found myself working at Target for the summer to help support my family and myself as well. In my time working there, I was trained in over three different positions to keep me well rounded and a team player when the store needed help or extra support for certain tasks. After some time working there, I also began training new hires who were going for the job that I was doing, which gave me a sense of belonging and helpfulness to my co-workers around me.  Being able to maintain this job has shown me how I can become a leader in my given space and grow into a leadership mindset.
